# VS Code plugin

We're offering two places from where you can install the plugin:
- [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ethersync.ethersync)
- [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/ethersync/ethersync)

thus you should be able to install it independent whether you're running VS Code or VS Codium.

## Confirm the installation

To confirm that the plugin is installed, try starting VS Code. It should show a message like "Connection to Ethersync daemon lost."
