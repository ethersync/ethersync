# Introduction

The main part of this documentation is aimed at users:

- [Getting started](getting-started.md) shows you how to install Teamtype, and how to make your first steps in it.
- [Concepts](concepts.md) goes into the fundamentals of how Teamtype operates, which is important for using it effectively.
- [Features](features.md) explains various things you can do with it (and some things you can't do yet).
- [Teamtype in practice](in-practice.md) contains detailed advice for how to use Teamtype for certain workflows.
- [Related projects](related-projects.md) lists other software which have attempted to build similar systems.

There is also a section aimed at people who want to help improving Teamtype:

- [Writing new editor plugins](editor-plugin-dev-guide.md) specifies the protocol we use for communicating between the daemon and editors, and lists other things a plugin needs to do.
- [What to learn from us](learn-from-us.md) might be interesting to you if you want to build new software like this, especially if you find this after Teamtype has died. ðŸ’€
