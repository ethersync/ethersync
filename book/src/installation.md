# Installation

Every user of Ethersync needs to install two components:

- The [**Ethersync daemon**](daemon.md) runs on your local machine, and is responsible for synchronization with other peers.
- A **plugin for your preferred text editor** â€“ currently, we offer a [Neovim plugin](neovim.md). The plugin will connect to the daemon, send it what you type, and receive other peoples' changes.
