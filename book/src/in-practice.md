# Teamtype in practice

Here we describe some use cases and workflows:
- [Pair programming](pair-programming.md) is interesting if you're collaborating with someone on code on an ad-hoc basis.
- [Shared Notes](shared-notes.md) describes a more long-term way of collaborating.
- [Working with Git](git-integration.md) describes some background and workflows in the context of using Git with Teamtype.
