# What to learn from us (after Ethersync is dead)

This page is written for people in the future, who discover Ethersync, and want to learn from it, to start their own project.

Maybe you don't agree with some of our technical choices. Or maybe you're unhappy with how we lead the project. But the most probable cause you're reading this is that we stopped to maintain and improve Ethersync, and the project is essentially dead. Looking at similar projects, many of them had the same fate.

Because of that, we want to give you as much useful information as we can, so that you can learn from our ideas and mistakes.

## The documentation

This documentation already gives you many insights into how Ethersync works and behaves. The list of related projects might be helpful for you to discover other approaches.

## The Architecural Decision Records

In addition to the documentation, we wrote a number of "architectural decision records", which each look at a certain problem we were facing, document the possible options, which one we picked, and why. We believe these records might be useful for future projects facing the same problems. You can find them here (TODO link).

## The editor plugins

Because of the not-invented-here syndrome, you're likely to code your own "core" for your project.

But one part of our existing code that could be most helpful to you, we think, is the code for the editor plugins. They speak quite a simple protocol, and maybe you can adapt them to your own needs, or look up how we solved certain problems (like Vim's infamous "implicit newline at the end of the file").

## Open invitation: Ask us anything!

We care about the problem we're trying to solve, and we probably will care in the future. Even if we're not actively working on it anymore, you're welcome to get in touch and ask us anything. The best way to reach us is: TODO.
