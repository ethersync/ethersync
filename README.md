## Install the daemon

<details>
<summary>Arch Linux</summary>
<br>
Install the [ethersync-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ethersync-bin) package from the AUR.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Nix</summary>
<br>
This repository provides a Nix flake. You can temporarily put it in your `PATH` like this:

```bash
nix shell github:ethersync/ethersync
```

If you want to install it permanently, you probably know what your favorite approach is.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Binary releases</summary>
<br>
The releases on GitHub come with [precompiled static binaries](https://github.com/ethersync/ethersync/releases/latest) for Linux and macOS. Download one and put it somewhere in your shell's [`PATH`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)), so that you can run it with `ethersync`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Via Cargo</summary>
<br>
If you have a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) installation, you can install Ethersync with `cargo`:

```bash
cargo install ethersync
```
</details>

## Basic usage

In one directory:

```
$ ethersync share

    To connect to you, another person can run:

    ethersync join 5-hamburger-endorse

Peer connected: adfa90edd932732ddf242f24dc2dcd6156779e69966d432fcb3b9fe3ae9831ab
```

In another directory (this can be on another computer!):

```
$ ethersync join 5-hamburger-endorse

Derived peer from join code. Storing in config (overwriting previous config).
Storing peer's address in .ethersync/config.
Connected to peer: 5e6b787fff79074735eb9b56939269100de1e37bc7f7a4d29c277cc24f7ee53d
```

The directories are now connected, and changes will be synced instantly. You can open text files (using editors with an Ethersync plugin), and start collaborating in real time! :sparkles:
