# üçÉ Ethersync

*Multiplayer mode for your text editor!*

Ethersync enables real-time collaborative editing of local text files. You can use it for pair programming or note-taking, for example. It's the missing real-time complement to Git!

![Demo video for how to make a connection and of collaborating in Neovim](https://files.blinry.org/ethersync-share-join-demo.gif)

## Features

- üë• Edit files at the same time, across different text editors
- üìç See your peers' cursors and selections
- üóÉÔ∏è Work on entire projects, the way you're used to
- üîí Encrypted peer-to-peer connections, no need for a server
- ‚úíÔ∏è Local-first: You always have full access, even offline
- üß© [Simple JSON-RPC protocol](https://ethersync.github.io/ethersync/editor-plugin-dev-guide.html) for writing new editor plugins

## What Ethersync is not

We are not a company, and don't sell anything. We don't require you to create an account. We don't have access to your data, and don't use it to train AI algorithms. We don't serve you ads, and don't track you.

We're just a bunch of people building something we want to see in the world.

## üö¶ Project status

The project is under active development right now. We use it every day, but there's still some [bugs](https://github.com/ethersync/ethersync/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%28label%3Abug+OR+type%3ABug%29) to be aware of.

## üì• Installation

### 1. Install the `ethersync` command

Ethersync works on Linux, macOS, Android, and on the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

<details>
<summary>Binary releases</summary>

The [releases on GitHub](https://github.com/ethersync/ethersync/releases/latest) come with precompiled static binaries. Download one and put it somewhere in your shell's [`PATH`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)):

- `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` for Linux
- `universal-apple-darwin` for macOS
- `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` for Android (use a terminal emulator like [Termux](https://termux.dev))

</details>

<details>
<summary>Arch Linux</summary>

```
sudo pacman -S ethersync
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Nix</summary>

To put `ethersync` in your PATH temporarily, run:

```
nix shell nixpkgs#ethersync
```

Make sure to also have it in your PATH when you run the editors, or install it to your environment in your preferred way.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Via Cargo</summary>

```bash
cargo install ethersync
```
</details>

### 2. Install an editor plugin

- [Neovim](https://github.com/ethersync/ethersync-nvim)
- VS Code/Codium: Install the "Ethersync" extension from the marketplace

## üìñ Basic usage

In the directory you want to share:

```
$ ethersync share

    To connect to you, another person can run:

    ethersync join 5-hamburger-endorse

Peer connected: adfa90edd932732ddf242f24dc2dcd6156779e69966d432fcb3b9fe3ae9831ab
```

Another person, in a separate directory (also works on the same computer):

```
$ ethersync join 5-hamburger-endorse

Derived peer from join code. Storing in config (overwriting previous config).
Storing peer's address in .ethersync/config.
Connected to peer: 5e6b787fff79074735eb9b56939269100de1e37bc7f7a4d29c277cc24f7ee53d
```

The directories are now connected, and changes will be synced instantly. You can open text files (using editors with an Ethersync plugin), and start collaborating in real time! :sparkles:
